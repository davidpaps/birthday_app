# Birthday App

During this week at Makers (Week 3) I started to learn about the MVC architecture and how to make a simple web based app. I decided to Test Drive this extra project to consolidate the weeks learning ahead of the weekends challenge.  This also acted as a refactor exercise, as I used class variables and methods for the first time, and refactored the code accordingly to be more efficient.

## Requirements 

Build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

*Wish the user happy birthday*

__OR__

Alert them in days as to how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday.

## Run the Program

Clone this repo, and in the command line type:

```
bundle install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, type in the command line:

```
rackup
```

Vist [*this*](localhost:9292) in your browser and fill Name, day and month criteria to find out if it is your birthday, or indeed how many days until your birthday!

In order to run the testing suite RSpec, open up the project directory in the terminal, and type in the command line type:

```
rspec
```
